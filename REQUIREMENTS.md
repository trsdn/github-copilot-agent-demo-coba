# Business Requirements -  Calculator

## Overview

This calculator serves as a multi-purpose computational tool designed for both general mathematical operations and specialized pirate crew management calculations.

## Core Business Functions

### 1. Basic Mathematical Operations

**Purpose**: Provide standard arithmetic calculations for everyday use.

**Requirements**:

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Support for decimal numbers with precision up to 10 decimal places
- Clear and delete functionality for error correction
- Real-time display of current and previous operands

**Business Value**: Enables users to perform quick calculations for personal or professional use.

### 2. Pirate Mode (Unusual Feature)

**Purpose**: Add a fun Easter egg that enhances the pirate theme without complicating calculations.

**Requirements**:

- When user enters a sequence: `7734` (spells "hELL" upside down), the calculator enters "Pirate Mode"
- In Pirate Mode, all operations work normally but with pirate flair
- For any calculation, display shows "ARRR!" for one second before showing the actual result
- Mode can be exited by pressing Clear twice
- Visual indicator when Pirate Mode is active

**Business Logic**:

- All mathematical operations function identically to normal mode
- The only difference is the temporary "ARRR!" message display
- No special calculation logic or treasure division formulas
- Maintains full calculator functionality while adding entertainment value

### 3. User Experience Requirements

**Visual Design**:

- Pirate-themed styling with nautical colors
- Responsive design for use on ship computers and mobile devices
- Large, easily clickable buttons for use with sea-weathered fingers

**Accessibility**:

- High contrast display for use in various lighting conditions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Clear visual feedback for all operations

## Technical Requirements

### Performance

- Calculations must complete within 100ms
- Interface must be responsive on devices with limited processing power
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB

### Browser Compatibility

- Support for all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- No external dependencies for core functionality

### Error Handling

- Division by zero displays "BLIMEY! Can't divide by zero, matey!"
- Invalid operations show appropriate error messages
- Calculator state preserved during errors (no unexpected resets)

## Business Rules

### Data Validation

- Numbers cannot exceed 999,999,999 (to prevent overflow)
- Maximum of 10 decimal places in results
- Automatic rounding for display purposes

### Security

- No sensitive data storage required
- Client-side only calculations (no server communication)
- Input sanitization to prevent calculation injection

## Success Metrics

- **Usability**: 95% of users should complete basic calculations without errors
- **Performance**: Page load time under 2 seconds
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for static hosting
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on pirate theme integration

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- Currency conversion for different types of treasure (doubloons, pieces of eight)
- Weather calculation mode for navigation assistance
- Crew scheduling calculator for watch duties
- Integration with ship's inventory management system
